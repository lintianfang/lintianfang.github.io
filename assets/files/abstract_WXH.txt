We present a novel multi-physics modeling framework for the numerical simulation of thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) problems in saturated porous media. A distinctive feature of the formulation is the use of the thermodynamically consistent hybrid mixture theory to derive the governing mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, followed by a novel scaling analysis, from which a rule of thumb is provided that justifies the simplification from a fully coupled thermal equation to its uncoupled counterpart. For the mass conservation equation, the new general volumetric thermal expansion coefficient $\beta_e$ is shown to be identical to the one derived from phenomenological theory under isotropy, thus confirming the veracity of both formulations and suggesting that this conservation equation can be derived in more than one way. To provide further insight into the theory, the node-based smoothed finite element method is adopted to discretize the governing equation in a monolithic fashion, and in this method, smoothed gradient matrices at four virtual integration points of a smoothing domain, along with a newly proposed smoothed thermal strain are used, which ensures integration stability and avoids variable mapping when mesh evolves. Furthermore, two-body multi-physics contact is achieved through the dual-Lagrange method, which condenses the system matrix to be solved. The proposed numerical framework is validated against four benchmark tests, conducted in both one-body and two-body multi-physics contact scenarios. Finally, the pipeline application results reveal the competition mechanism between thermal expansion and friction degradation, and how these factors influence the soil resistance. Overall, this study offers a promising contribution to the understanding and modeling of complex multi-physics problems.
